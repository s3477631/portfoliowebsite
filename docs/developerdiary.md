I initially spent a significant amount of time fiddling with javascript and producing small experiments in isolation. 

I am paying particular attention to my methodology and can already notice an improvement in organisational skills. However, far more work is required to dispell my irrational belief that particular parts of the planning process are unnecessary. 

I've made great strides in fleshing out the site today - by linking together and refining some of my "draft" work earlier on in the piece. I still like javascript, but Im starting to feel some of its limitations - module loader/webpack/etc - far beyond the scope of this assignment. 

So far the assignment has been javascript heavy, and this has been to satiate my own natural curiosity and desire to continue learning. Ideally I would like to balance this out by refining the essential elements and to coming back to the concept stuff when I have more time.

I've noticed an interesting characteristic with scss animation - when I inact the animation transition by hovering over the image, the image and the upper layer rotate in synchronisty. However, I would say due to the limitations of events perculating through sibling elements that when we hover over the label for the image it rotates, leaving its sibling element (the image) in a stationary position. 

I've made the mobile and desktop layouts - but some work is required for the tablet layout - will utilise another media query and create break points - this time I will also consider the layout of the grid items, so that a different aesthetic can be created. 

I've decided to slightly change the format of information on the site by displaying a completed commerical project page (which I hope will blossom into completed commerical projects) as well as a ("working projects page") - which by definition need only show the concept of a working project, however, and also by definition I hope to keep working on this working project.
