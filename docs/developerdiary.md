I initially spent a significant amount of time fiddling with javascript and producing small experiments in isolation. 

I am paying particular attention to my methodology and can already notice an improvement in organisational skills. However, far more work is required to dispell my irrational belief that particular parts of the planning process are unnecessary. 

I've made great strides in fleshing out the site today - by linking together and refining some of my "draft" work earlier on in the piece. I still like javascript, but Im starting to feel some of its limitations - module loader/webpack/etc - far beyond the scope of this assignment. 

So far the assignment has been javascript heavy, and this has been to satiate my own natural curiosity and desire to continue learning. Ideally I would like to balance this out by refining the essential elements and to coming back to the concept stuff when I have more time.
