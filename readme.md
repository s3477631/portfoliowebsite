> Desktop layout of home page.
  - Each image spins around on-hover or tap or mobile, it then navigates to an appropriate area of the site. 
  - certain bugs were left in for amusement purposes (events do not propagate from child span to parent div onhover).

  - tablet may seem a little stretched on the simulator - but it works fine on the real device.

> everything works fine, ... except. 
        > the image overlay of the scrolled images needs to be resized and a scrolling animation written for the transition. 
        > text from the first page input needs to be parsed through.
